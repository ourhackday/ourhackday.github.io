Static Jekyll site for the hack day

## Using Jeckyll
Jeckyl is a lightweight, static website generator that is supported by Git Hub Pages. For local development you'll need to use Ruby – for further information about installation and usage, see:

* https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/
* http://jekyllrb.com/

Once you're all set up with Jeckyll, run "bundle exec jekyll serve" on the command line and start editing. The website preview will then be available at:

http://localhost:4000/

Note: don't edit anything in the _site folder, as this is auto generated and gets overwritten every time the site is updated by Jeckyll.

## Team biographies data

The data driving the team page is in _data/team.json
