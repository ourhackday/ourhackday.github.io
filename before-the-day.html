<h2>What you need to do before the day</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you’ve let us know your travel arrangements in plenty of time to allow us to pay for and book your travel</li>
  <li>Make sure you know your way to the venue, once you get into the centre of Edinburgh</li>
  <li>There will be beer! Just letting you know, in case this affects how you intend to get home at night, and you can plan in advance</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from that, we’d just encourage you to look over the resources and on the day pages, and have a think about the types of thing we might be looking to get you today. Bear in mind some of the event will test your coding skill, if you want. However, some of it will be testing your overall problem-solving approach, so please consider this when you’re reviewing the resource material!</p>

<h2>Stuff you need to bring on the day</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you can bring your own device (particularly if you intend to be developing &ndash; everyone’s development set up is different) that would be great. Wireless internet access will be available all day</li>
  <li>Pens and pencils, for helping sketch out your ideas and sell these to others</li>
  <li>Your brain</li>
  <li>Your enthusiasm</li>
  <li>That’s it! Everything else should be provided</li>
</ul>
