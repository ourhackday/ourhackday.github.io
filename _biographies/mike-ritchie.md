# What's your name ?

Mike Ritchie

# What do you do ?

I manage the Development Team in Digital IT.  I'm all about getting
the software development practices right, and building the team's
capability.

# Biography

I've been working in software development for close to three decades,
in many industry sectors - pharma, small startups, investment banking,
medical visualisation software, logistics & transportation. Probably
some other stuff.  I once wrote an application (really, a proper
application - for actual money) that basically counted toilet rolls.
This was not a career high point.  Not even sure why I mentioned it.

# Key skills

- Patience

- Developer therapy and psychoanalysis

- Magic

# What do you do in your spare time ?

Play with my Lego.  I want to stress this is not a euphemism, I
actually play with Lego.

# What's your spirit animal

Platypus, honey badger, or rat.  A "honey ratypus", if you're ok about
accepting imaginary hybrid animals.
