<h2>When you arrive</h2>

<p>When you arrive, report to the front desk.</p>

<h2>What you'll be doing</h2>

<p>So&hellip; we’re going to keep the details as a bit of a surprise &ndash; but to give you a bit of background for the day&hellip;</p>

<p>We’ll be asking you to come with some ideas about how to make use of the IoT - and technology in general - to make pet insurance more exciting and engaging for our customers. We’re looking for you to develop a customer portal of sorts, that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lets you check in on your pet’s performance and health, and compare this with your friends and pet owners across the country</li>
  <li>Lets you communicate with other pet owners &ndash; post pictures, share stories and so on</li>
  <li>Gives you access to simple veterinary advice</li>
  <li>Makes buying pet insurance as easy as possible &ndash; and if your pet’s a healthy one &ndash; you get a discount too!</li>
</ul>

<p>We only have a day, so we’re not looking for polish. If you get things working &ndash; great. If you don’t; it doesn’t matter, as long as you can articulate your ideas and show us what you have been able to achieve. We’re looking for people that think digitally &ndash; and we’re looking for you to show us your ideas in creative ways. </p>

<p>There will also be a few surprises along the way &ndash; but we’ll keep those to ourselves!</p>

<p>Around lunchtime, we’ll have access to the Game Masters event downstairs. We’d love it if you took the opportunity to take a look around &ndash; we’re sure it will keep the creative juices flowing. But if you’d rather just crack on, it’s entirely up to you.</p>

<p>We aim to finish up around 1630, to give us time to speak with each of you about your ideas.</p>

<h2>After the Hackathon</h2>

<p>Once we’ve picked our winners on the day and handed out our fantastic prizes, then we’ll have some drinks. There, you can ask us anything you want to know about Tesco Bank, our graduate scheme, our Digital programmes, about our spirit animals&hellip; anything else you want! If we know the answer, we’ll tell you</p>
